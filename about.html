            <p class="card-text" style="font-size: larger;">As a 4th-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, I have consistently demonstrated my dedication and leadership at school. Since my first year, I have been actively involved in the Computer Society as the treasurer, managing finances and ensuring the smooth operation of our activities. My academic excellence is reflected in my achievements as a 1st-year president lister and a 2nd-semester dean's lister in my second year. Additionally, I am currently leading my capstone project, where I guide and collaborate with my peers to deliver innovative solutions.</p>

            <p class="card-text" style="font-size: larger;">At home, I am the eldest and only daughter, now 21 years old. I've been independent since elementary school, balancing responsibilities and personal growth from a young age. As a dedicated furmom, I take care of my seven cats and even breed them, ensuring they are well-loved and nurtured. My hobbies include cooking, playing online games, listening to music, and designing application GUIs. I also enjoy browsing the internet, exploring new ideas and trends. This blend of creativity, responsibility, and independence defines my everyday life at home.</p>
